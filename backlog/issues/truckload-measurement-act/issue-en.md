# [Issue] Problem Statement, Structural Analysis, and Systemic Proposal on Truck Load Regulation

---

## ■ Problem Statement: Legal Standards Exist, But the System Is Dysfunctional

### ◆ A Structural Escape Clause: "It's Legal, So It's Allowed"
- Even if an accident occurs, actors can claim compliance due to vague standards.
- Absence of a measurement obligation leads to nominal legality.
- Dangerous practices continue under formal legal cover.

### ◆ Accidents and Social Losses Occur Despite Seeming Compliance
- Height limits (3.8m) are enforced via visual estimates.
- No measurement requirement means "I followed the rules" can’t be disproven.
- Frequent highway accidents and cargo spills.
- On-site workers and drivers are often scapegoated.

### ◆ Media Reporting Triggers Social Penalties
- Responsibility lies with system design, yet individuals are blamed.

## ■ Structural Analysis of Root Causes

### [1] Legal Deficiency: Standards Without Enforceability
- Without mandatory measurement, standards are symbolic.
- If no data is recorded, violations cannot be proven—no liability.

### [2] Ambiguous Accountability Structure
- Responsibility among shipper, transporter, operator, and driver is unclear.
- The weakest actors—field workers—are punished.

### [3] Loss of Data Sovereignty Due to Foreign Cloud and AI Dependence
- Data stored on AWS, Azure, etc., escapes Japanese legal control.
- Foreign cloud dependence undermines infrastructure sovereignty.

### [4] Weak Forestry and Logistics Infrastructure
- Wood and similar goods must be transported on small trucks due to rural infrastructure collapse.
- Concentration of such loads onto highways creates system-wide risk.

## ■ Proposed Solutions via Systemic Legal Reform

### [A] Legalize Mandatory Measurement
- Require measurement of all loads (3.8m standard remains).
- Obligate recording, storage, and registration in the cloud.

### [B] Domestic Cloud Registration Only
- Prohibit AWS, Azure, GCP; use Japanese domestic cloud providers.
- Legal guarantee of data sovereignty and national security.

### [C] National AI Use Only
- Prohibit foreign AI for detection or analysis.
- Create incentive/subsidy systems for domestic AI growth.

### [D] Public Measurement & Reporting Infrastructure
- Enable anonymous citizen reports of dangerous loading.
- Deploy automatic measurement gates at logistics hubs and highway entrances.

### [E] Worker Protection Measures
- Immunity for field workers following proper procedures.
- Caution media against careless fault assignment without due process.

## ■ Legislative Outcome
This issue analysis served as the foundation for the draft proposal:
**"Truck Load Measurement and Safety Act"**

The law aims to ensure safety, clarify systemic accountability, protect frontline workers, and reclaim national control over logistics infrastructure and data governance.

End.

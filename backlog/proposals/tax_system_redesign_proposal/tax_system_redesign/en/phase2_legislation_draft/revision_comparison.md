## **1. Structural Comparison of Legal Frameworks (Existing Law vs. Reform Bill)**

| Item | Existing Consumption Tax Act | True Consumption Tax Reform Bill |
|------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Purpose of the System** | General revenue (nominally for social security) | Social security-purpose tax (use legally restricted) |
| **Tax Base** | Goods and services (broadly defined) | Categorized by item (three-tiered rate system) |
| **Tax Rate Structure** | Uniform rates (standard 10%, reduced 8%) | Zero, reduced, and standard rates (0%, 5%, 10–15%) |
| **Basis for Rate Determination** | Uniform across product types | Based on social necessity and ability to pay |
| **Invoice System** | Mandatory (business registration required) | Abolished (rate determined by item classification) |
| **Anti-Regressivity Measures** | Minimal (limited reduced rate) | Institutionalized zero rate for essential goods |
| **Use of Revenue** | Allocated to general budget (opaque usage) | Exclusively for pensions, healthcare, and welfare |
| **Consistency with Legal System** | No explicit linkage with Constitution or fiscal laws | Designed in alignment with Japan's Six Codes |
| **International Compatibility** | Separated from customs codes and OECD standards | Alignable with HS codes and BEPS-compliant design |

## **2. Article-Level Correspondence Examples**

| Article | Existing Law | After Amendment (Reform Bill) |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| **Article 1 (Purpose)** | Taxation on general consumption | Explicitly defined as a social security-purpose tax |
| **Article 6 (Tax Rate)** | Standard rate 10%, reduced rate 8% | Three-tiered system: zero / reduced / standard |
| **Article 30+ (Deductions)** | Invoice-based deduction system | Deductions largely abolished; simplified input tax calculation |
| **Supplementary Provisions** | Invoice introduction & transitional measures | Invoice abolition, effective date, and revision of related laws |

## **3. Summary**

This bill is not a partial revision but a **comprehensive overhaul** of the current consumption tax system, addressing its philosophical, legal, and social deficiencies.

It redefines consumption tax not as a tool for fiscal revenue, but as a **mechanism of social justice**. As such, the relationship between the current and proposed systems is not that of amendment, but of **fundamental replacement**.

> This bill represents a **genuine and legitimate reconstruction**  
> — in principle, in legal coherence, and in societal acceptance.  
>  
> That is the essence of the **True Consumption Tax Reform Bill**.

## Policy Proposal on True Consumption Tax Reform

## 1. Purpose of the Proposal

This proposal aims to correct the current situation in which the existing consumption tax system has deviated from its originalÁêÜÂøµ, causing serious impacts on citizens‚Äô lives, social security, and the credibility of the tax system. The objective is to return to the origins of taxation and reconstruct it as a ‚Äútax to support living.‚Äù

Specifically, consumption tax shall not be treated merely as a general revenue source, but shall be legally and institutionally defined as a **‚Äúsocial security purpose tax,‚Äù** with strict restrictions on its use. At the same time, the tax structure will be redesigned into zero-rate, reduced-rate, and standard-rate tiers to ensure fairness and sustainability.

Through simplification and transparency, this proposal seeks to eliminate the invoice system, reduce the burdens on small and medium-sized businesses, align with international frameworks (tariff systems, OECD tax principles), and establish a true tax system that earns public trust.

## 2. Background and Current Recognition

Consumption tax was introduced in 1989 by the Takeshita Cabinet as a ‚Äútax for welfare.‚Äù However, in practice, revenues were used in areas beyond social security, treated institutionally as general revenue. Furthermore, its regressive nature has disproportionately burdened low-income households, especially those in poverty.

Operationally, the complexity of the reduced tax rate system and the heavy burdens imposed by the invoice system (fully implemented in 2023) on SMEs have highlighted structural issues. These cannot be solved by minor operational improvements; fundamental redesign is required.

At the same time, securing sustainability for social security remains urgent. A stable revenue source is indispensable. Hence, a fundamental review of the consumption tax system is needed to restore public trust and create a functional tax regime.

## 3. Identification of Issues

The main problems of the current consumption tax system and related frameworks are:

- **(1) Regressivity**  
  Overburdening low-income households and undermining fairness.

- **(2) Lack of transparency in usage**  
  The original purpose of ‚Äúfor social security‚Äù has been hollowed out, with revenues diverted to general funds.

- **(3) Complexity**  
  Reduced tax rates are ambiguous, and the invoice system creates excessive burdens for SMEs.

- **(4) Lack of systemic/legal consistency**  
  Misalignment with fiscal law, social security law, constitution, etc., undermining legal stability.

- **(5) Lack of international consistency**  
  Insufficient alignment with tariff systems and OECD international taxation principles.

## 4. Basic Policy of Reform

This reform will redesign the consumption tax system both institutionally and ethically, based on:

- **(1) Repositioning as a social security purpose tax**  
  Legally restrict revenues solely to social security.

- **(2) Relief for essential goods**  
  Zero or reduced rates for necessities, easing regressivity.

- **(3) Simplification and SME support**  
  Eliminate the invoice system, apply item-based taxation.

- **(4) Legal/systemic consistency**  
  Harmonize with constitution, fiscal law, civil law, corporate law, etc.

- **(5) International consistency and accountability**  
  Align with OECD, WTO, FTA/EPA frameworks.

## 5. Outline of System Design

### (1) Redesign of Tax Structure: Item-Based Tiered Rates
- **Zero rate (0%)**: staple foods, medicines, public education, welfare/care services  
- **Reduced rate (5%)**: processed foods, hygiene products, utilities, private education  
- **Standard rate (10‚Äì15%)**: dining out, alcohol/tobacco, leisure, luxury goods

### (2) Designated Use of Revenues
- Legally restricted to 3 areas: pensions, health/long-term care insurance, child/welfare support  
- Mandatory Diet reports & web disclosure

### (3) Abolition of Invoice System
- Item-based tax rates replace invoice complexity  
- Major burden reduction for SMEs

### (4) International Consistency
- Linked with HS codes, compatible with OECD/BEPS rules  

### (5) Legal Foundation Strengthening
- **Constitutional reform**: Art.25 & new Art.84-2 for social security tax  
- **Fiscal law reform**: limit deficit bonds, prioritize earmarked taxes  
- **Civil law reform**: align public assistance with welfare benefits

### (6) Income & Corporate Tax Reform
- Progressive tax redesign, unified taxation incl. capital income  
- New top rate (e.g. 50% for ultra-high incomes)  
- Corporate: minimum tax, internal reserve taxation, overhaul of exemptions

### (7) Export Refund & Tariff Policy Alignment
- Restrict excessive VAT refunds on exports, impose caps  
- Integrated with customs policies  

### (8) Fiscal Defense via Transparency
- Introduce ‚Äúpurpose tax ledger‚Äù with annual disclosure  
- Serves as fiscal sovereignty safeguard and defense

## 6. Expected Outcomes

- **Fairness restored**: easing regressivity, institutional fairness  
- **Strengthened trust in social security**: revenues exclusively for welfare  
- **Reduced SME burden**: simplified system, no invoices  
- **Legal stability**: harmonized six major laws  
- **International alignment**: easy policy explanation abroad

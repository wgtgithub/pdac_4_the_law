To the Speaker of the House of Representatives  

### [Petition] Request for Commencement of Legislative Deliberations on Tax Reform Proposals and Draft Bills  

Dear Sir,  

I would like to extend my deep respect for your tireless efforts in the daily administration of national affairs.  

As one of the sovereign people, I hereby express serious concerns regarding the current tax system—particularly the consumption tax system and the legal basis of fiscal management—and formally submit this petition as follows:  

### [Petition Requests]
1. In discussions on the current consumption tax system, please take realistic measures in light of the constraints of the Tax Law and the Fiscal Law.  
2. Redesign the current tax system fundamentally, and promptly shift to a structure that enables effective fiscal management.  
3. Based on the tax reform proposal already prepared for submission, commence formal legislative deliberations in the National Diet.  

### [Summary of Petition]  

This is not a mere request, but a formal petition based on a concrete legal proposal.  

With regard to the actual use of consumption tax revenue and its relation to government bond redemption, the current system is seriously inconsistent with both the Constitution and the Fiscal Law. The necessity of rectification is evident.  

As a sovereign citizen, I have prepared a proposal that independently redesigns the entire system.  

This action is not limited to exercising the right of petition under Article 16 of the Constitution; it is also a demand for concrete legislative action addressed to your House, the “supreme organ of state power” under Article 41 of the Constitution.  

Any shelving, neglect, or dismissal as outside jurisdiction would constitute a denial of the constitutional rights guaranteed to the people, and will by no means be tolerated.  

Respectfully,  

Petitioner: Jun Takeshita (Name or Organization)  
Contact: As published in the House of Representatives Bulletin No. 97 of the 217th Diet, issued June 16  
Attachment: Proposal (Printed Document)

## Draft Request Letter Regarding Submission of WORD Files (Supplement)
---

### [Request]
Ensuring a means of electronic submission in WORD format  

At present, petitions and requests tend to be handled in a perfunctory manner due to their submission in paper format. However, when the contents of a bill proposal are complex and technical, the necessity of submission by electronic file (particularly in Word format) is extremely high.  

Therefore, I hereby submit the following request for consideration regarding the establishment of an electronic submission channel:  

### [Requested Measures]
1. Establish within the Secretariat of the House of Representatives a dedicated electronic submission channel (a kind of suggestion box) for the general public to submit bills and proposals in electronic file formats such as Word.  
2. Create a mechanism that allows multiple proposals to be submitted, referred to, and managed continuously on a monthly basis.  
3. Ensure that submitted documents are treated as official records and are properly shared with the Speaker and relevant committees.  

I am convinced that the establishment of such an electronic submission system is indispensable for promoting citizen participation in policymaking and realizing popular sovereignty under the Constitution.  

I respectfully request your positive response.

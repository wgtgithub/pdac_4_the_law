## Structural Reform Proposal on Consumption Tax System

### Proposal Title:
Ensuring Fiscal Stability and Social Justice through Structural Redesign of the Consumption Tax System

---

### Background:
Since its introduction in 1989, Japan's consumption tax system has undergone several rate revisions. However, the system has significant legal and structural deficiencies, leading to the following issues:

- Regressive burden disproportionately affecting low-income citizens
- Preferential treatment for large corporations through export tax refunds
- Lack of autonomy for local governments in the local consumption tax system
- Structural mismatch between consumption tax revenue and social security funding
- Contradictions with Article 4 of the Public Finance Act and disjointed legal frameworks

Furthermore, in the event of retaliatory tariffs (e.g., 25%) from major trading partners such as the United States, the current tax system lacks the flexibility for responsive fiscal measures or economic stimulus, undermining Japan’s economic autonomy.

---

### Objectives:
1. Reconstruct the consumption tax system with legal and institutional consistency
2. Ensure progressivity and social equity
3. Establish a flexible fiscal and taxation system that supports citizens’ lives
4. Secure institutional stability and resilience to withstand international competition

---

### Proposal Details:

#### 1. Clarification of Legal Connectivity Across Tax Laws
- Restructure the consumption tax law to align with civil law, commercial law, corporate tax law, and local autonomy law
- Reorganize legal definitions, taxable entities, and non-taxable transactions

#### 2. Correction of Regressiveness and Simplified Rate Structure
- Consider income-linked consumption tax credits (deductions for low-income earners)
- Introduce zero tax rates for essential goods

#### 3. Reform of Export Tax Refund System
- Increase transparency and set upper limits on tax refunds for large corporations
- Clearly differentiate between tax refunds and export subsidies

#### 4. Redesign of Local Consumption Tax System
- Grant discretion to local governments (e.g., adjustable tax rates and transparent usage)
- Reassess the connection with the local allocation tax system

#### 5. Automatic Linkage Mechanism with Social Security
- Allocate a fixed percentage of tax revenue to pensions, healthcare, and nursing care automatically
- Visualize fund usage for citizens (via a public dashboard)

#### 6. Crisis-Responsive Framework
- Introduce flexible tax rate operation rules in response to economic shocks such as trade friction or natural disasters
- Revise connection with the Public Finance Act (e.g., special provisions during crises)

---

### Expected Outcomes:
- Improved consistency and credibility of the tax system
- Mitigation of consumption tax burden and enhanced public acceptance
- Enhanced resilience of Japan's economic structure against external pressures (e.g., tariffs)
- Stabilization of domestic demand and smoothing of tax revenue

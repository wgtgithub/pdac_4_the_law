**Policy Proposal on True Consumption Tax Reform**

## 1. Purpose of the Proposal

This proposal aims to rectify the current consumption tax system, which has deviated from its original purpose and is causing serious consequences for public life, social security, and trust in the tax regime. It seeks to return to the fundamentals of tax policy by restructuring the consumption tax as a system that supports daily life.

Specifically, it repositions the consumption tax not as a general-purpose revenue source, but as a clearly defined "social security purpose tax" in both legal and institutional terms. The use of its revenue will be strictly limited, and a new tax rate structure will be implemented‚Äîcomprising zero, reduced, and standard rates‚Äîto ensure fairness and sustainability.

Through simplification and transparency of the system, the proposal aims to eliminate the need for the invoice system, reduce burdens on small businesses, and achieve consistency with international standards such as customs rules and OECD taxation principles. This policy paper marks the first step toward building a truly acceptable and sustainable tax system.

## 2. Background and Current Issues

The consumption tax was introduced in 1989 by the Takeshita Cabinet as a "tax for welfare." However, over time, its revenue has been broadly allocated beyond social security, treated institutionally as part of the general budget. Additionally, its regressive nature imposes a disproportionate burden on low-income individuals, impacting them significantly.

Further challenges include the complexity of the reduced tax rate system and the heavy administrative burden of the invoice system, which fully came into effect in 2023. These issues cannot be addressed through minor operational adjustments; a fundamental redesign of the system is necessary.

Meanwhile, securing sustainable funding for social security is urgent and unavoidable. Therefore, the consumption tax must be fundamentally revised to regain public trust and function as a reliable tax system.

## 3. Key Issues

The main issues with the current consumption tax system and related frameworks include:

1. **Regressivity**: Imposes excessive burden on low-income groups, undermining tax fairness.
2. **Opaque Revenue Use**: The original purpose of funding social security has become a mere formality, with revenue absorbed into the general budget.
3. **System Complexity**: Ambiguities in reduced tax rate coverage and burdensome invoice system for small and micro businesses.
4. **Lack of Legal/Systemic Consistency**: Inconsistencies with other related laws (Public Finance Law, Social Security Laws, Constitution, etc.) undermine legal stability.
5. **Lack of International Alignment**: Misalignment with international standards, such as customs regulations and OECD tax principles.

These challenges call for a structural overhaul of the tax system.

## 4. Fundamental Principles of Reform

This reform will redesign the consumption tax system from both institutional and ethical perspectives based on the following principles:

1. **Redefining as a Social Security Purpose Tax**: Legally restrict the use of consumption tax to social security funding, prohibiting its diversion. This guarantees the connection between taxes and welfare.
2. **Reduced Tax on Essentials**: Apply zero or reduced tax rates to essential goods and services to ease regressivity and support living standards.
3. **Simplification and SME Support**: Eliminate the invoice system, shift to a product-based tax classification to ease the burden on both taxpayers and businesses.
4. **Ensuring Legal Consistency**: Harmonize with relevant laws including tax laws, finance laws, the Constitution, and corporate law to ensure a sustainable legal framework.
5. **International Compatibility and Accountability**: Align with OECD standards, WTO agreements, and FTAs/EPAs to ensure global consistency and transparency.

## 5. Overview of System Design

### 1. Redesigned Tax Structure: Product-Based Tiered Rates

- **Zero Rate (0%)**: Staple foods (rice, vegetables, dairy), prescription medicines, public education, welfare and nursing services
- **Reduced Rate (5%)**: Processed foods, hygiene products, rent, utilities, private education services
- **Standard Rate (10‚Äì15%)**: Dining out, luxury goods (alcohol, tobacco), entertainment, premium services

### 2. Clarifying Revenue Use

Revenue from consumption tax will be strictly used for the following social security purposes:

1. Public pension benefits
2. Medical and nursing care insurance
3. Welfare systems like child allowances and maternity/childcare support

Reports on revenue usage will be submitted to the Diet and disclosed online to ensure public accountability.

### 3. Abolishing the Invoice System and Simplification

- Replace entity-based assessments with product-based taxation, eliminating invoicing complexity.
- Significantly reduce administrative burdens on small and micro businesses.

### 4. Ensuring International Compatibility

- Product-based taxation can align with HS codes, allowing integrated customs policy.
- Supports compliance with BEPS 2.0 and OECD tax rules.

### 5. Legal Infrastructure Reform (Constitution, Finance Law, Civil Code)

- **Constitutional Amendment Plan**: Add obligation to guarantee social security through taxation under Article 25; create Article 84-2 to establish a social security purpose tax system.
- **Finance Law Amendment**: Introduce clauses prioritizing earmarked taxes and restricting deficit bond issuance.
- **Civil Code Amendment**: Modify Article 877 to clarify consistency with public support structures and eliminate duplicate support obligations.

### 6. Reforms to Income and Corporate Tax Systems

- **Income Tax Reform**: Redesign progressive tax brackets, integrate capital gains into comprehensive taxation, and add a new high-income tax rate (e.g., 50%).
- **Corporate Tax Reform**: Introduce minimum tax rate, tax on retained earnings, and overhaul special tax incentives to restore fairness.

### 7. Reforming Export Tax Refunds and Customs Policy Alignment

- Current export refunds act as implicit subsidies, distorting tax fairness.
- Review the system to limit refunds to final export products and impose annual refund ceilings to ensure compliance with WTO rules and fiscal integrity.

### 8. Fiscal Sovereignty and Defensive Transparency

- Introduce a ‚ÄúPurpose Tax Ledger‚Äù to publicly disclose annual consumption tax revenue, expenditures, and balances.
- Mandatory online and Diet reporting, reinforcing not only accountability but also **fiscal sovereignty as national defense against misuse or external interference**.

## 6. Expected Benefits

- **1. Restored Fairness and Public Trust in Taxation**: Reduced regressivity through targeted tax relief for essential goods.
- **2. Enhanced Trust in Social Security**: Citizens clearly understand how their taxes contribute to supporting others, promoting social solidarity.
- **3. Reduced Business Burdens and Economic Activation**: Eliminating the invoice system and simplifying the structure will reduce SME costs and stimulate activity.
- **4. Legal Stability and Consistency**: Greater integration with six core legal codes (Constitution, Civil Code, Corporate Law, Tax Law, Finance Law, Administrative Law).
- **5. International Alignment and Accountability**: Compliance with global tax norms ensures easier domestic and international policy communication.

## 7. Implementation Roadmap

A phased legislative and implementation approach is required. The process will be:

### Step 1: Finalization of System Design and Draft Law (Year 1)
- Finalize proposal details and legislative draft
- Coordinate with income, corporate, and other related tax laws
- Prepare draft submission to the Diet

### Step 2: Submission and Enactment (Year 2)
- Coordinate with political parties, bureaucrats, and experts
- Conduct hearings and public comment
- Submit and deliberate bill in Diet, address supplemental resolutions

### Step 3: Awareness and Preparation Period (Year 3)
- Announce detailed system design and prepare manuals
- Conduct stakeholder briefings (businesses, municipalities)
- Allow 6‚Äì12 months for transitional preparation

### Step 4: Enforcement and Monitoring (Year 4+)
- Enforce law and establish monitoring system
- Annual reporting and review; update system as needed

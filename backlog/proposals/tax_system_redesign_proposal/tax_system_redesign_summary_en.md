## [Consumption Tax Structural Reform: Summary Chart]

### 1. Problems
- **Regressiveness**: Greater burden on lower-income households

- **Lack of local discretion**: Local consumption tax without autonomy for local governments
- **Unfair export tax refund system**: Preferential treatment for large corporations
- **Weak link with social security**: Revenue connection is opaque and inefficient

### 2. External Risks (e.g., 25% U.S. tariff)

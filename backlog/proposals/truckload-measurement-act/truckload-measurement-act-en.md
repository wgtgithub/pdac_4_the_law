### Chapter 3: Measurement Obligation and Data Registration

**Article 5 (Mandatory Measurement of Cargo)**  
Before transport, cargo size must be measured by the carrier using one of the following methods:
- Government-approved smart device application
- On-board automatic measurement sensor
- External measurement station

**Article 6 (Retention of Measurement Records)**  
Measurement records must be retained together with transport logs for at least 90 days and be available for inspection if necessary. This retention period ensures accountability in case of accidents or violations during or after the transport process.

**Article 7 (Mandatory Data Registration)**  
Before transport, the following measurement data must be registered in a government-designated cloud system that is located within Japan and not operated or managed by foreign entities. Use of foreign cloud infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is prohibited to safeguard data sovereignty and national security:
- Vehicle registration number
- Cargo height, length, width
- Measurement method
- Time of measurement
- Identifier of measuring person or automated recording device

### Chapter 4: Reporting and Monitoring Infrastructure

**Article 8 (Hazardous Cargo Reporting System)**  
Citizens may report suspected hazardous cargo via a government-provided reporting app. The app and all related systems must be domestically hosted and free from foreign operational control. Foreign cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and GCP are explicitly excluded. All reports will be analyzed by AI systems developed and operated within Japan. No foreign AI models or engines may be used in the evaluation process.

**Article 9 (Measurement Support Infrastructure)**  
The national and local governments shall establish public measurement stations at key logistics hubs, highway interchanges, and material centers, capable of 24-hour unmanned automatic measurement.

### Chapter 5: Penalties

**Supplementary Article 1 (Protection of Field Workers)**  
This Act guarantees the legal safety of all field workers involved in transportation and loading operations. When proper measurement, recording, and registration are carried out, workers shall not be held unjustly responsible. Media outlets are urged to refrain from premature attributions of fault that may cause undue social damage.

**Article 10 (Penalty for Failure to Measure)**  
Failure to measure cargo prior to transport shall result in the following administrative actions:
- First violation: Official guidance and improvement report requirement
- Second violation: Fine up to 300,000 yen and training order for transport managers
- Third and subsequent violations: Suspension of operations and mandatory corrective planning

**Article 11 (Joint Liability in Major Accidents)**  
If cargo exceeding legal limits is transported without proper measurement, resulting in a load spill or accident, joint liability shall apply to:
- The shipper
- The transport manager
- The person responsible for issuing loading instructions

**Article 12 (Exemption from Liability)**  
Where measurement has been properly conducted and records have been saved and registered, the carrier and driver shall not be held liable for negligence by default in the event of an accident.

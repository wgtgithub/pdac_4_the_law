# **True Consumption Tax Reform Bill – Legislative Purpose Statement**

---

## **1. Introduction**

This bill seeks to fundamentally correct the serious institutional and social issues embedded in the current consumption tax system, which has strayed far from its original purpose.

Originally introduced as a "tax for welfare," the consumption tax has, over time, become increasingly regressive, complex, and worn out, undermining public trust and placing a growing burden on households and the economy. Now is the time to return to its founding principles and reconstruct the system based on the idea that **“taxation exists to support society.”**

---

## **2. Philosophy of Reform**

- **Clarifying in law that taxes exist for welfare**  
  → Redefine the consumption tax as a *social security-purpose tax*

- **Ensuring tax burdens are fair and proportionate to ability to pay**  
  → Correct regressiveness through item-based and progressive tax rates

- **Creating a tax system that is understandable, simple, and accountable to the public**  
  → Abolish the invoice system and disclose the use of tax revenues transparently

- **Aligning the tax system with domestic and international legal frameworks**  
  → Ensure consistency with the Six Codes, customs law, and international tax principles

## **3. Basic Structure of the Bill**

The bill aims to redesign the consumption tax system through the following structure:

- **General Provisions**: Objectives and definitions  
- **Taxation Structure**: Introduction of item-based taxation with zero, reduced, and standard rates  
- **Use of Tax Revenue**: Restrict the use of consumption tax revenue to pensions, healthcare, and welfare  
- **Simplification Measures**: Exempt the invoice system from application  
- **Transparency**: Mandate reporting and public disclosure of tax revenue use  
- **Supplementary Provisions**: Effective date and provisions for related legal revisions

## **4. Vision of the Bill**

This bill is not merely about adjusting tax rates or making administrative improvements.  
It is a **complete redesign of the philosophy and practice of national finance**—a rethinking of how society is supported through taxation.

Our aim is to create a system in which:

- **Citizens can pay taxes with confidence**, and  
- **People can genuinely feel that their taxes are tangibly supporting others.**

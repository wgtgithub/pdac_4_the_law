# ðŸ§¾ Summary of the "True Consumption Tax Reform" Policy Proposal

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective of the Proposal

To fundamentally reform the existing consumption tax systemâ€”addressing its regressive nature, lack of transparency, and structural complexityâ€”by redesigning it as a **"Tax for Social Security Purposes"**.

---

## ðŸ”§ Key Reform Points

1. **Legal Restriction of Tax Use to Social Security**
   - Tax revenue strictly allocated to pensions, healthcare, and child support
   - Annual reports to the National Diet and public disclosure of usage

2. **Redesign of Tax Structure (Item-based, Tiered Rates)**
   - **Zero Rate**: Essential food, medical supplies, public education
   - **Reduced Rate**: Processed foods, rent, electricity/gas, hygiene items
   - **Standard Rate**: Dining out, luxury goods, alcohol, entertainment

3. **Abolition of the Invoice System**
   - Shift to item-based taxation removes the need for invoice validation
   - Significantly reduces administrative burdens for SMEs

4. **Balance of International Consistency and Simplicity**
   - Aligned with HS code (customs classification system)
   - Compatible with OECD standards, including BEPS 2.0

# Structure of the Six Codes: Control Model Based on Buke Shohatto and Slave Law

---

## Overview

Japanâ€™s Six Codes (Roppou) are not merely the legal system of a modern nation-state.
At their ideological foundation lie the following two historical systems of control:

- **Buke Shohatto**: An order management device based on class hierarchy and family system under the Tokugawa shogunate  
- **Slave Law**: A system that excludes personhood and institutionalizes humans as "assets" or "labor resources"
- **Unequal Clauses**: Additional clauses from the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Japan and the United States that favor foreign capital and introduce legal ambiguity into investment-related regulations

Looking across all six codes, each legal corpus reflects these two governance models, making it clear that the Six Codes function as an architecture through which the state manages and utilizes its people as order and resource.

## ðŸ”¹ Institutional Transfer of Buke Shohatto Elements into the Six Codes

### â–  Civil Code: Inheritance of the family system and institutionalization of patriarchal rule

- **Edo Background**: Patriarchal authority, family head succession, strict filial piety â†’ Feudal order
- **Institutional Transfer**:
  - Meiji Civil Code (1898): Institutionalized the family as a legal unit (family head system, inheritance system)
  - Current Civil Code (post-1947): Adopted individualism, but remnants of family hierarchy persist in parental authority and support obligations
  - The family registry system (koseki) continues to function as a state surveillance mechanism based on household units

---

### â–  Penal Code: Systematization of harsh punishment against disruption of ruling order

- **Edo Background**: Prevention of rebellion and insubordination, maintenance of lord-vassal relationships
- **Institutional Transfer**:
  - Crimes such as obstruction of public duties, defamation, and insults reflect strong responses to attacks on authority and social order
  - Criminal penalties protect state institutions from "insults" (analogous to disloyalty to oneâ€™s lord)
  - Penal justification of speech control under the name of public order

---

### â–  Commercial Code: Control of distribution and feudal inheritance of credit

- **Edo Background**: Control of townspeople, guild systems, status-based credit
- **Institutional Transfer**:
  - State monitoring and institutionalization of distribution order via licensing and exchange systems
  - Credit investigation agencies and commercial registries replace feudal trust based on origin or status
  - Modern equivalents of feudal trust seen in corporate rating and credit screening culture

---

### â–  Constitution: Symbolization of state authority and religious sublimation of governance ideology

- **Edo Background**: Shogun as the source of order, loyalty above law
- **Institutional Transfer**:
  - The Emperor is positioned as a "symbol" and a spiritual foundation of national unity (Article 1)
  - Loyalty transitions from legal to moral, achieving internalized governance
  - Traditional values like "respect for heritage" and "family love" reproduced culturally via laws like the Basic Act on Education

---

### â–  Criminal Procedure Code: Procedural theatricality and prioritization of state order

- **Edo Background**: Arbitrary decisions at magistrate offices, torture and emphasis on confession
- **Institutional Transfer**:
  - Current system still values confession and downplays the right to remain silent (e.g., substitute prisons)
  - When state order is the goal, "formal due process" is placed above "substantive truth"
  - Jury trials provide openness but leave room for arbitrary manipulation and public opinion control

---

### â–  Civil Procedure Code: Discrimination in judicial access by status and economic condition

- **Edo Background**: Daimyo not judged, commoners had no recourse, litigation access depended on class
- **Institutional Transfer**:
  - High costs and evidentiary burdens effectively deny access to those lacking economic capital
  - Access and cost gaps in securing legal representatives reinforce status-based stratification in judicial usage

---

## ðŸ”¹ Institutional Transfer of Slave Law Elements into the Six Codes

### â–  Civil Code: Management of people as "household units" or "labor resources" over individual personhood

- **Slave Law Background**: People treated as property or labor, not as individuals
- **Institutional Transfer**:
  - Obligations of support, labor contracts, and unpaid domestic labor institutionalize "intra-household labor"
  - Employer-employee relationships reflect slave-like management: duty of obedience, restricted freedom to terminate

---

### â–  Penal Code: Exemplary punishment and imposition of moral norms

- **Slave Law Background**: Deviance = disruption of order, harsh punishment as deterrent
- **Institutional Transfer**:
  - Penalties influenced more by social reaction than by the actual harm of acts (e.g., theft, fraud, violence)
  - Emphasis on maintaining social order reproduces slave-like punitive control over resistance

---

### â–  Commercial Code: Structure prioritizing efficiency and profit over human dignity

- **Slave Law Background**: Neglect of personhood, commodification of humans
- **Institutional Transfer**:
  - Freedom of corporate management, employees treated as costs
  - Legalization of shareholder supremacy as a modern form of capital-based control

---

### â–  Constitution: Institutionalization of obedience as a moral norm

- **Slave Law Background**: Internalization of rule, moralization of submission
- **Institutional Transfer**:
  - Concepts like loyalty to the state and public welfare serve as bases for restricting rights
  - Despite guarantees of fundamental rights, provisions like Article 13 enable abuse under the guise of public interest

---

### â–  Criminal Procedure Code: Hollowing of procedure and unilateral state punishment

- **Slave Law Background**: Formal hearings, substantive suppression
- **Institutional Transfer**:
  - Long detentions, convenience-based indictments, conviction rates over 99%
  - Frequent wrongful convictions reflect prioritization of control over justice

---

### â–  Civil Procedure Code: Formal assurance and substantive deprivation of right to sue

- **Slave Law Background**: Nominal right to sue, functionally denied
- **Institutional Transfer**:
  - Formal freedom to file lawsuits vs. actual barriers of cost and complexity
  - System transforms into a control device under the mask of "freedom," excluding the poor and minorities

---

## ðŸ”¹ Unequal Clauses from the Treaty of Amity and Commerce and Their Institutional Integration

### â–  Civil Code: Legalization of freedom of contract and preferential treatment for foreign capital in international transactions

- **Treaty Background**: Extraterritoriality prevented disputes with foreigners from being tried under Japanese law, creating both caution and legal preference for foreign capital
- **Transfer into Civil Code**:
  - Japanese law applies in principle, but parties can freely choose governing law (Civil Code Article 7, General Principles of Applicable Law Act)
  - In international contracts, foreign laws are often applied, undermining Japanese law and enabling avoidance via choice of law

---

### â–  Commercial Code: Legal framework for deregulated enterprise activity and foreign capital protection

- **Treaty Background**: Low tariffs and open markets legally guaranteed foreign access
- **Transfer into Commercial Code**:
  - Few restrictions on foreign company formation; joint-stock company system premised on affinity with Western capital
  - Foreign capital restrictions mostly repealed (limited to exceptions under the Foreign Exchange Act)
  - Disclosure standards under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act often relaxed for foreign firms

---

### â–  Tax Law (as an intermediate between Constitution and Commercial Code)

- **Treaty Background**: Loss of tariff autonomy fostered a structure privileging foreign capital over domestic industry
- **Impact on Tax System**:
  - Corporate tax law features weakened anti-tax haven measures and tax treaties granting exemptions to foreign entities
  - Excessive tax preferences for foreign companies (e.g., special corporate tax deductions)
  - Tax treaties often limit Japanâ€™s taxation rights on foreign corporations operating domestically

---

### â–  Constitution: Coexistence of formal sovereignty and substantive subordination

- **Treaty Background**: Legacy of extraterritoriality limiting Japanese sovereignty
- **Transfer into Constitution**:
  - Article 98 and the Preamble establish the supremacy of treaties over domestic law
  - Legalization of a double structure where Japan is a sovereign state in name but subordinated to external treaties in practice

---

### â–  Criminal Procedure Code: Introduction of international human rights standards and reaction to extraterritoriality

- **Treaty Background**: Excessive institutionalization of procedural justice and human rights protections as a reaction to extraterritoriality
- **Transfer into Criminal Procedure Code**:
  - Special protections for foreign suspects: embassy involvement, interpreter obligations
  - In contrast, outdated interrogation practices remain for Japanese citizens, creating a dual structure

---

### â–  Civil Procedure Code: Litigation access for foreigners and issues of governing law

- **Treaty Background**: Legal protection and access for foreigners justified unequal clauses
- **Transfer into Civil Procedure Code**:
  - Easier access for foreign plaintiffs in international litigation (jurisdiction flexibility, international service arrangements)
  - Meanwhile, Japanese citizens face difficulties (language, cost, governing law barriers) in accessing international courts

## Conclusion: What is the Six Codes?

> The Six Codes, while proclaiming "freedom" and "justice," are in essence an architecture of control designed for maintaining national order and continuity of governance.

The system established under the name of modern law is a reconstructed legacy of:
**Samurai order-based control Ã— Slave-like resource management**

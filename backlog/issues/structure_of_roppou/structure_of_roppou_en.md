# Structure of the Six Codes: Buke Shohatto × Slave Law Governance Model

---

## Overview

Japan's Six Codes are not merely a modern state's legal system.  
At their core, they embed two historical governance structures:

- **Buke Shohatto**: The Edo Shogunate's mechanism for class and family-based order management  
- **Slave Laws**: Systems that depersonalize individuals, institutionalizing them as "assets" or "labor resources"

An examination of each code reveals how they inherit these two governance models, serving as architectures for the state to manage and utilize its citizens as order and resources.

## Civil Code: Intermediate Governance through the Family System

- **Buke Shohatto Elements**: Inheritance of family headship, patriarchal system, control by the head of the household
- **Slave Law Elements**: Management of labor resources and property by family units, prioritization of "family" order over individual personality

> The Civil Code institutionalizes a structure where "the state manages individuals through families," rather than "guaranteeing individual rights."

---

## Criminal Code: Punitive System for Disloyalty

- **Buke Shohatto Elements**: Severe punishment for rebellion and disloyalty, maintenance of master-servant relationships
- **Slave Law Elements**: Excessive penalties and deterrence for deviation and rebellion

> The Criminal Code functions not as "a shield protecting citizens' freedom," but as "a sword defending state order."

---

## Commercial Code: Contractual Freedom Device for Capital Protection

- **Buke Shohatto Elements**: Maintenance of distribution order, merchant control, credit-first principle
- **Slave Law Elements**: Disregard for personality in favor of productivity and efficiency, treating humans as assets

> The Commercial Code institutionalizes "freedom favorable to capital," providing a framework where the state ensures market order.

---

## Constitution: Authority Legitimation as a Faith Device

- **Buke Shohatto Elements**: Shogun as the symbol of order, loyalty equated with justice
- **Slave Law Elements**: Internalization of governance through morality and religion, institutionalization of obedience to authority

> The Constitution, while professing "sovereignty of the people," still contains "national myths," serving as a device to legitimize governance structures.

---

## Code of Criminal Procedure: Optimization of Punitive Logistics

- **Buke Shohatto Elements**: Arbitrary procedures by magistrates, acceptance of torture, performative trials
- **Slave Law Elements**: Unilateral sanctions by those in power, formalized procedures for control

> The Code of Criminal Procedure is designed not for "the realization of justice," but as "a state processing flow to smoothly administer punishment."

---

## Code of Civil Procedure: System Access Filtering Device

- **Buke Shohatto Elements**: Bias in trial outcomes based on status
- **Slave Law Elements**: Deprivation of the right to sue, practical inaccessibility

> The Code of Civil Procedure, while advocating "equality of rights," functions as a filter selecting who can utilize the system.

---

## Conclusion: What Are the Six Codes?

> The Six Codes, while proclaiming "freedom" and "justice," are in fact governance architectures designed for "state order" and "continuation of control."

The systems constructed under the name of modern law inherit and reconstruct a dual governance model of **samurai class order control × slave-like resource management**.

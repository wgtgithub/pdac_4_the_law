## Purpose of Submission (Explanatory Note)

The purpose of this Act is to ensure that freedom of expression is not unjustly restricted on the grounds of acts involving the national flag or other national symbols, by explicitly guaranteeing freedom of symbolic expression.  
In conjunction, this Act abolishes legal frameworks that impose compulsory respect toward national symbols and establishes a system preventing ideological intervention by the State.

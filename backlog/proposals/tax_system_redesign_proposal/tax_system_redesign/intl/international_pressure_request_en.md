## 🧭 A Formal Statement on Japan’s De Facto Loss of Sovereignty

---

### 🟥 1. The Reality: Nominal Sovereignty, Substantive Dispossession

The Constitution of Japan defines, in Article 1, that “the Emperor shall be the symbol of the State,” and from Articles 1 through 8, the Imperial institution is treated as a constitutional “sanctuary.”  
While Article 12 and Article 13 affirm fundamental human rights and the respect for individual dignity, and Article 25 guarantees the right to a minimum standard of living, the principle of **popular sovereignty** remains only a formal ideal.

In practice, Japanese citizens are not granted the means to draft legislation or to restructure national systems from the ground up.  
Though elections are held to select representatives, those elected are not equipped—or permitted—to write laws independently, and remain mere **custodians of an administrative system subordinated to the symbolic monarchy and the postwar political regime**.

### 🟧 2. The Cause: A Constitution Designed to Dismantle Sovereignty

The root cause of this condition lies in the fact that the current Japanese Constitution was drafted not by the Japanese people, but by **GHQ (General Headquarters of the Allied Powers)** as an occupying force following World War II.  
Although it outwardly guarantees civil liberties and equality, the core design of the Constitution structurally **prevents citizens from engaging in direct institutional change**.

Three systemic mechanisms are particularly critical:

1. **The "Untouchable" Imperial Clauses (Articles 1–8)**  
   - Both lawmakers and legal scholars regard these articles as taboo, rendering them effectively **immune from amendment** and placing the symbolic Emperor at the system’s unchallengeable center.

2. **Absence of Civic Sovereignty Education**  
   - Legal education in Japan teaches that laws must be “obeyed,” not “created,” systematically erasing the idea that citizens can act as authors of law.

3. **The Electoral System as a Sovereignty Burial Device**  
   - Citizens are trained to believe that voting equals democracy, effectively **preventing them from exercising their rightful role in changing the system**.

### 🟨 3. Path to Recovery: Reclaiming Sovereignty Through Structural Redesign and External Pressure

Correcting this situation requires a multi-step approach:

#### ① Structural Disclosure  
- Reveal and clarify the embedded logic of **sovereignty denial** within the Japanese Constitution, tax system, and fiscal law.
- Specifically highlight how Constitutional Article 84 and Fiscal Law Article 4 are effectively ignored in practice.

#### ② Legislative Reclamation  
- Reestablish the principle that **citizens have the right to write laws**, not merely vote for those who enforce them.
- Build a system where legislative proposals can emerge directly from citizens, displacing the passive “law school guardian” model.

#### ③ Constructive External Pressure  
- Appeal to the **U.S. Presidency, the European Parliament, the United Nations, and relevant international NGOs**, to recognize and challenge Japan’s **structural disenfranchisement of its own citizens**.
- Internal reform by singular “exceptional individuals” is consistently suppressed or ignored, making **external democratic intervention essential**.

### 🟦 4. Why the Message Is Not Understood Within Japan

This appeal is not widely understood within Japan, due to systemic educational and media-based obfuscation:

- Legal education focuses on rote memorization of existing laws, conditioning people to believe “laws cannot be changed” and “elections are the only political tool.”
- The media refrains from analyzing structural issues, focusing instead on party approval ratings and candidate personalities.
- Consequently, **systemic critique is treated as extremism, and those who raise it are marginalized or silenced**.

## ✅ Final Statement

> **The idea that Japan is a functioning democracy is a grand illusion.**  
> **The people, who should be the authors of law, are structurally barred from that role by a double-layered mechanism—symbolic monarchy and inert parliamentary ritual.**  
>
> **This system was not built by the Japanese people but imposed through postwar occupation. It remains a form of psychological and legal colonization.**  
>
> Therefore, achieving genuine democracy in Japan requires **the reclamation of legislative power by the sovereign people** and **an international effort to pressure the Japanese government to enact constitutional reform and authorize citizen-led referenda.**

This proposal has been made public for the international community.  
We formally request support in applying constructive pressure on the Japanese government to facilitate **constitutional revision, tax system redesign, and democratic reform led by the people themselves.**

> We hope this proposal will serve as the catalyst for a new era in which the people of Japan reclaim their rightful place as the architects of their nation’s laws and destiny.

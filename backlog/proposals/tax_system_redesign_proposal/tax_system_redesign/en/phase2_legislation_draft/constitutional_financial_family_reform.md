# Comprehensive Legislative Amendment for Establishing a Social Security-Purposed Taxation System

---

## 1. Purpose of the Amendment

This bill aims to correct legal and structural inconsistencies in the current tax and social security systems, thereby establishing a sustainable and equitable framework for national fiscal policy.

Specifically, it seeks to institutionalize the use of taxes—particularly the consumption tax—as a revenue source dedicated to social security, with strict usage limitations and monitoring mechanisms. This ensures the legitimacy of taxation and secures public trust and understanding.
